We as a group picked <font color="red"> abortion<font color="white"> because we should stop this kind of act. This act is an act of <font color="red">killing<font color="white"> someone with no problems at all. If you will have <font color="red">sex<font color="white"> with each other you should be ready no matter what happens. You should be ready as a parent. You should not kill you own child because you are <font color="red">not ready<font color="white">. They did not wish to be birth it’s your <font color="red">obligation<font color="white"> to raise the child and not kill them. We should stop this because poor babies are being <font color="red">killed<font color="white"> without them knowing what is the problem of their <font color="red">death<font color="white">. They should be treated with love and care they should not be killed because they are born to be your child and you have to treat them with love and care.

A little more than half of the unintended pregnancies result from non-use of contraception, about 43% from inconsistent or incorrect use, and only 5% from contraceptive failure. Unintended pregnancies are reduced by providing free contraceptives, by using the most effective contraceptive methods, and by emergency contraception. Mandating insurance coverage of birth control can cut abortion rates by 62% to 79% compared to the national rate. Oral contraceptives meet all the FDA safety requirements for over-the-counter sales, so moving them to the drug stores will make them much more accessible. Fund research studies on more highly effective, affordable, and easy-to-use birth control methods for men and women. Children whose mothers had access to birth control have higher family incomes and college completion rates. Therefore, the Affordable Care Act’s contraception coverage mandate* should be enforced.

<p align="center">

Recent Title X changes* reduced clinical capacity of reproductive health clinics by 46%, negatively affecting 1.6 million family planning patients. Restore the program to pre-2019 standards,* rescind the global and the domestic gag rule,* and improve funding to increase capacity and provide comprehensive high-quality reproductive health care to those in need.


</p><h3> <p align="center"> <font color="red">Solution 3<font color="white">-Teach comprehensive sex education </font></font></p></h3><font color="red"><font color="white">
<p align="center">
<br>

Sex education is only mandated in 25 US states, only 13 states mandate that the information provided is medically accurate; in 19 states contraception must be included while 25 mandate that abstinence be stressed. Teens who receive comprehensive sex education programs are significantly less likely to become pregnant.

<br>
73% of women undergoing an abortion said that being unable to afford a baby now was a reason for the abortion. That number rose to 81% for women below the federal poverty line. And while the abortion rate for American women declined by 8% between 2000 and 2008, among poor American women it increased by 18%.
<br>
Raise the minimum wage to $15.* Pass the gender-equal pay legislation.* Guarantee paid sick leave* and unemployment insurance.* Two-thirds of minimum-wage workers are women, which leaves working women living below the poverty level.
<br>
Support paid family and medical leave;* more expansive family leave laws are associated with lower abortion rates.
<br>
Provide child tax credits;* a $1000 increase in the maximum credit has been associated with a 7.6% decrease in the overall abortion rate.
<br>
Subsidize child care for working parents*(83% of parents of kids under age five called finding quality affordable child care a serious problem), universal pre-school,* pre- and after school programs, children’s meals in schools and throughout the summer,* and continue nutrition assistance programs,* free community college and or trade certificates.* Some studies find that any kind of provision of government benefits — welfare, child care — has an impact on lowering the abortion rate.

Pregnant people consistently cite concerns about their health or potential health issues with the fetus as a reason for wanting an abortion. Ensure health care coverage* for all family members that include mental health and addiction services that are available, accessible, and affordable so people can conceive, deliver, nourish, and raise healthy children from conception to college graduation.

•To state the point of views about abortion. While public support for legal abortion, it has fluctuated some in two decades of polling, it has remained relatively stable over the past several years. Currently, 61% say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 37% say it should be illegal in all or most cases.
